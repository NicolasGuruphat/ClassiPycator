# ClassiPycator  

Allows you to sort your files by extension

## How to use it ?

- First, you have to tell which folder you want to sort (I initially made this project to sort my download folder but you can choose any folder).  
    - By default, the folder chosen will be where the .py is located. 
    - You can change the file with the UI
- Then, you choose where you want your files to go.
- After that the sorting begins. 
    - A folder is created for each extension
    - Each file goes to the corresponding folder
