# ClassiPycator  

Allows you to sort your files by extension

## How to use it ?

- First, you have to tell which folder you want to sort (I initialy made this project to sort my download folder but you can choose any folder).  
    - By default, the folder choose will be where the .py is located. 
    - You can change the file with the UI
- Then, the sort of the folder you chosen will begin. The element will be moved to folderPath (you have to modify this variable directly in the .py file)
